  # The system uses:
  # 1. Guardian-specific tokens from Firestore (primary method)
  # 2. Web scraping as fallback (works without credentials, may have limited access)
  # 3. Basic Display API tokens can be set per-guardian in Firestore
  # If you need global fallback credentials, you can add them here as RUNTIME-only secrets
