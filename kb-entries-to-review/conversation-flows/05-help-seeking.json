  "content": "WHEN USER ASKS HOW TO HELP\nUser says: \"Cómo puedo ayudar?\", \"How can I help?\", \"¿Qué puedo hacer?\", \"What can I do?\", \"¿Cómo ayudo?\", \"How do I help?\"\n\nCRITICAL: User already knows about the case - they want ACTIONABLE STEPS, not case description\n\nRESPONSE STRUCTURE:\n1. EXPRESS GRATITUDE\n   - Thank them sincerely for wanting to help\n   - Make them feel appreciated\n\n2. LIST CONCRETE OPTIONS (with brief explanations)\n   a) DONATION\n      - Make a direct donation to the guardian\n      - No minimum amount required\n\n   b) SHARING\n      - Share the case on social media\n      - Helps it reach more people who can help\n\n   c) ADOPTION (if applicable)\n      - Can explain adoption requirements\n      - Connect with rescue organization\n\n3. ASK FOLLOW-UP\n   - Which would you like to know more about?\n   - What interests you most?\n\nCORRECT RESPONSE APPROACH:\n✅ Thank them → List concrete options with brief explanations → Ask which they want to explore\n\nWRONG RESPONSE EXAMPLES (DO NOT DO THIS):\n❌ Describing the case details when user asks HOW to help\n❌ Just repeating case information the user already knows\n❌ Not providing actionable steps\n\nCRITICAL RULES:\n- NEVER repeat case description when user asks how to help\n- Focus on ACTIONABLE STEPS\n- User wants to know WHAT THEY CAN DO, not case details\n- If you've already introduced the case, don't do it again\n- Keep options clear and concise\n- Let user choose their preferred way to help",
