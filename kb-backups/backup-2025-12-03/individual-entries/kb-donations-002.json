  "content": "VERIFICATION PURPOSE\n- Donors should provide proof of transfer (bank document, wallet receipt, screenshot, etc.) if they want the donation to count as verified and earn totitos\n- Verification is optional but recommended to earn totitos and improve user rating\n- No penalties for unverified donations - donations still help the cause\n\nVERIFICATION PROCESS\n- Verification happens weekly with guardians\n- Guardians review and approve donations after cross-checking with their records\n- Once guardian approves, donor receives automatic notification\n- Donors then earn their totitos for verified donations\n\nIF VERIFICATION FAILS\n- If verification fails, we contact the donor for further verification instructions\n- Ask donors to provide more detailed information about the transfer (date, amount, transaction ID)\n- Work collaboratively with donor to resolve any verification issues\n\nGUARDIAN-LED VERIFICATION\n- If the donor does not verify the donation, but the guardian verifies it independently (with user-specific data), we notify the user to claim their totitos\n- This ensures donors don't miss out on totitos even if they forget to upload receipt",
